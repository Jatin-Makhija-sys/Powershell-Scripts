.SYNOPSIS
    Creates a WDAC/App Control for Business supplemental policy that allows Google Chrome 
    to run by defining a Publisher rule.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script generates a supplemental ACfB policy for Google Chrome. 
    It scans the Chrome installation directory, builds Publisher-level rules (with hash fallback), 
    associates the supplemental policy with the specified base policy using its PolicyID, 
    and compiles the XML into a deployable CIP/BIN file.

.PARAMETER $scanPath
    The file path to the Google Chrome installation directory that will be scanned to create allow rules.

.PARAMETER $outXml
    The output path where the generated XML policy file will be saved.

.PARAMETER $baseId
    The PolicyID of the base policy this supplemental policy should be linked to.

.PARAMETER $outBin
    The output path where the compiled CIP/BIN file will be saved.

.EXAMPLE
    To generate a supplemental policy allowing Google Chrome:
    .\ACfB_Allow_Chrome_Supplemental.ps1
    
    This will create an XML and a compiled CIP file that can be deployed through Intune or another 
    management solution as a supplemental policy to the existing base policy.
